# Compositing

The compositor blends multiple layers of media, such as videos and graphics, into one final output. Compositing is used for programmable visual effects and overlaying graphics. Each layer is blended with the previous layer.

## Layers

Each layer plays a clip. Each layer has its own effects chain, where effects can be applied onto the layer before blending.

## Adding clips

To add clips, simply drag a file from a file explorer into an empty clip slot. To remove the clip, hover over the clip master and click the "X" on the top-right.

## Controls

### Blend mode

You can customize how layers are overlayed by changing the blend mode. The blend mode determines how layers are overlayed with each other.

## Effects chain

Each layer has its own effects chain. Different effects can be applied onto a layer. Effects are processed before the layer is composited.
