## About Equinox
Equinox is a modular, multimedia application created in TouchDesigner, designed for real-time compositing, VJ-ing and audioreactive performances. Equinox implements a comprehensive workflow and interface that makes VJ-ing easier and more accessible for artists.<br>

Equinox is a sole developer project still in alpha development.<br>

## Features
* __Master effects chain__ - Equinox has a library of effects that can be inserted into the master effects chain. These effects can be rearranged and edited.
* __Media compositor__ - Equinox has an integrated, multimedia compositor with adjustable decks and columns that mixes clips with the main signal. Each deck has its own designated effects chain, allowing for modular, creative experimentation.
* __Grading suite__ - Color grading tools
* __Macro system__ - Simultaneous modulation of different parameters, with filters to affect the output signal. Each export can be enabled or disabled. Macros can be controlled by MIDI.
* __Camera viewport__ - Camera viewport allow for camera adjustments and scene adjustments while VJ-ing live. <br>

## Planned features
* Saving/loading projects
* Saving/loading effect presets on the go
* Fully mappable MIDI interface
* More integrated and configurable audio analysis
* More control over compositing & programming clips
* General optimisations
* Set automatable cue points for videos
* BPM Sync / envelopes
* VRAM optimisation (somehow...)

## Background

Equinox is a sole developer project by me (unami). I'm a 15 year-old student and TouchDesigner artist, and a creative artist for PAREIDOLIA. To support our work, consider testing our software!

Equinox was developed for PAREIDOLIA, a nightclub host delivering audioreactive, synthetic visuals and raising humanitarian aid for MAP and Gazan soup kitchens. You can view our works [here]("https://www.instagram.com/pareidolia.collective/")!
