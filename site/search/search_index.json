The effect will be immediately applied, and you can customize it by clicking on the chevron to drop down its parameters.</p> <p></p> <p>Each effect has its own dry/wet slider and alpha gate. The dry/wet slider determines the ratio between the dry (unprocessed) and wet (processed) signal. The alpha gate also determines if the effect is active or not.
